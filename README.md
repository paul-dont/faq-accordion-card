## My process

I started by defining the markup for the card then i styled it using a mobile first approach and fixed responsivenes right after and lastly added the functionality for the buttons.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Stacking images on top of one another multiple times is quite tricky to manage and display correctly especially when responsive design comes to play. Also overflow has complications with fixed / absolute positioned elements.

### Continued development

The desktop design images need a small adjacement.
